# HTTP/3 rollout and lifecycle

HTTP/3 uses QUIC over UDP on `TARDIGRADE_QUIC_PORT`; HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 remain
on the configured TCP listener. Firewalls, security groups, and load balancers
must explicitly permit UDP to the QUIC port. Allowing TCP/443 does not make
HTTP/3 reachable.

The supported v1 deployment model is one Tardigrade process owning one UDP
runtime and one in-process Destination Connection ID routing table. NAT
rebinding and the configured migration policy are handled inside that process.
Multi-process `SO_REUSEPORT`, eBPF, or external DCID steering is not part of the
current support promise.

## Advertisement

`TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ENABLED=true` starts the native listener when TLS credentials
are available and the UDP socket can bind. It does not advertise HTTP/3 by
itself.

`TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ALT_SVC=auto` advertises only while the runtime is actually
ready to accept QUIC/H3 connections. `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ALT_SVC=off` keeps the
listener running without emitting an active `Alt-Svc` alternative, which allows
staged rollout and rollback.

`TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ALT_SVC_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` controls the bounded `ma` value
emitted with active advertisements. Values above 86400 are rejected.

During drain or rollback withdrawal, eligible TCP responses emit
`Alt-Svc: clear` so clients can discard cached alternatives. Tardigrade strips
upstream `Alt-Svc` response headers and emits at most one gateway-owned
`Alt-Svc` value.

## Reload

Advertisement-only knobs can hot reload:

- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ALT_SVC`
- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ALT_SVC_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`

Listener-owned HTTP/3 knobs require a process restart because the current
runtime does not atomically replace a live UDP socket and QUIC connection table:

- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ENABLED`
- `TARDIGRADE_QUIC_PORT`
- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_CONNECTION_MIGRATION`
- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_RETRY_POLICY`
- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_ENABLE_0RTT`
- `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE`

A reload that changes one of those fields is rejected before publication. The
old config, old runtime, and old effective advertisement remain active.

## Drain and rollback

Graceful rollback order is:

1. Withdraw advertisement (`Alt-Svc: clear`).
2. Begin H3 drain; the runtime sends HTTP/3 GOAWAY and refuses new work.
3. Let admitted streams finish until `TARDIGRADE_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS`.
4. Close remaining QUIC connections, remove CID routes, then stop or restart
   the listener.

`TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_RETRY_POLICY=address_validation` enables stateless QUIC Retry
before connection allocation. `off` is the default. `TARDIGRADE_HTTP3_CONNECTION_MIGRATION=false`
allows the hardened NAT-rebinding behavior; enabling migration broadens that
policy and is restart-required.
