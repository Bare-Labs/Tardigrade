//! Native ACME client surface for every shipping profile (#379, #649).
//!
//! Imported directly by the gateway and TLS termination code. Contains no
//! `@cImport` and no OpenSSL in any profile. The issuance/renewal workflow,
//! which needs EC key generation, CSR building, and signing, is not yet
//! available on the native path and fails closed rather than silently
//! doing nothing. Automated ACME is tracked alongside the native TLS
//! matrix (#391). (Historically this file's OpenSSL-backed implementation
//! lived under this name and this native surface was `acme_client_stub.zig`;
//! #649 retired the OpenSSL implementation and promoted this surface to
//! the file's name.)
